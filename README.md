Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a supervised machine learning technique which is used for tasks such as classification, dimensionality reduction and pattern recognition. It seeks to model the difference between classes by projecting the data into lower dimensions.

OBJECTIVE:

The main objective of this task is to use the features 'age', 'BMI', 'HbA1c level' and 'blood glucose level' to find a 'w' vector to be used for linear discriminant analysis for binary classification.
We should first standardize the data by dividing the feature values by respective standard deviation.
